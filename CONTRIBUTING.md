# Contributing

Your contributions are highly appreciated, and they will be duly recognized.

Before you proceed to create an issue or a pull request, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our contribution guide.

## Etiquette

This project thrives on the spirit of open-source collaboration. Our maintainers dedicate their precious time to creating and upholding the source code, and they share it with the hope that it will benefit fellow developers. Let's ensure they don't bear the brunt of abuse or anger for their hard work.

When raising issues or submitting pull requests, let's maintain a considerate and respectful tone. Our goal is to exemplify that developers are a courteous and collaborative community.

The maintainers have the responsibility to evaluate the quality and compatibility of all contributions with the project. Every developer brings unique skills, strengths, and perspectives to the table. Please respect their decisions, even if your submission isn't integrated.

## Relevance

Before proposing or submitting new features, consider whether they are genuinely beneficial to the broader user base. Open-source projects serve a diverse group of developers with varying needs. It's important to assess whether your feature is likely to be widely useful.

## Procedure

### Preliminary Steps Before Filing an Issue

- Try to replicate the problem to ensure it's not an isolated occurrence.
- Verify if your feature suggestion has already been addressed within the project.
- Review the pull requests to make sure a solution for the bug isn't already underway.
- Check the pull requests to confirm that the feature isn't already under development.

### Preparing Your Pull Request

- Examine the codebase to prevent duplication of your proposed feature.
- Check the pull requests to verify that another contributor hasn't already submitted the same feature or fix.

## Opening a Pull Request

To maintain coding consistency, we adhere to the PSR-12 coding standard and use PHPStan for static code analysis. You can utilize the following command:

```bash
composer all-check
```
This command encompasses:

- PSR-12 Coding Standard checks employing PHP_CodeSniffer.
- PHPStan analysis at level 8.
- Execution of all tests from the `./tests/*` directory using PestPHP.

We recommend running `composer all-check` before committing and creating a pull request.

When working on a pull request, it is advisable to create a new branch that originates from the main branch. This branch can serve as the target branch when you submit your pull request to the original repository.

For a high-quality pull request, please ensure that you:

- Include tests as part of your patch. We cannot accept submissions lacking tests.
- Document changes in behavior, keeping the README.md and other pertinent documentation up-to-date.
- Respect our release cycle. We follow SemVer v2.0.0, and we cannot afford to randomly break public APIs.
- Stick to one pull request per feature. Multiple changes should be presented through separate pull requests.
- Provide a cohesive history. Each individual commit within your pull request should serve a meaningful purpose. If you have made several intermediary commits during development, please consolidate them before submission.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
