## Missing Functions

### Descriptive Statistics

- Weighted median - median with weights (like fmean supports weights, but median doesn't)
- Standard error of the mean (SEM)
- Mean absolute deviation (MAD)


### Correlation & Regression


- Kendall tau correlation - another rank-based correlation
- Multiple/polynomial regression
- R-squared (coefficient of determination)

### Hypothesis Testing

- T-test (one-sample, two-sample, paired)
- Chi-squared test
- Z-test
- P-value calculation
- Confidence intervals

### Other Distributions (beyond Normal)

- Student's t-distribution
- Chi-squared distribution
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Uniform distribution
- Exponential distribution

### Outlier Detection

- IQR-based outlier detection (the building blocks exist with firstQuartile/thirdQuartile, but no dedicated method)
- Z-score based outlier detection

### Ranking & Order Statistics

- Rank - assign ranks to data points
- Percentile rank - what percentile a given value falls at
